	"content": "  Installing daSWAG CLI Installation types We provide 2 ways of working with daSWAG. If in doubt, choose our 2nd option, \u0026ldquo;Installation with Npm\u0026rdquo;:\n Installation with Npm is the classical way of working with daSWAG. Everything is installed on your machine, which can be a little complex to set up, but that\u0026rsquo;s how most people usually work. In case of doubt, choose this installation. Installation with Yarn is the same as classical \u0026ldquo;Installation with Npm\u0026rdquo;, but using Yarn instead of Npm. Please note that Yarn is a lot less popular than Npm in our community, so this isn\u0026rsquo;t a recommended option for newcomers.  Prerequisites  Install Python 3.7 from Python Software Foundation (please use only 3.7.x versions, others are not supported yet).  Installation with Npm (recommended for normal users)  Install Node.js from the Node.js website (please use an LTS 64-bit version, non-LTS versions are not supported) Install daSWAG: npm install -g daswag-cli  Now that daSWAG is installed, your next step is to create a project\nInstallation with Yarn (alternative to Npm) This is the same procedure as using Npm, with two differences:\n Instead of upgrading Npm in step 3, install Yarn from the Yarn website Use yarn global add instead of Npm install -g, for example:  To install Yeoman, type: yarn global add yo To install daSWAG, type: yarn global add daswag-cli   Troubleshooting If you have problems using Yarn globally, be sure to have $HOME/.config/yarn/global/node_modules/.bin in your path.\nOn Mac or Linux: export PATH=\u0026quot;$PATH:`yarn global bin`:$HOME/.config/yarn/global/node_modules/.bin\u0026quot;\nOptional installations  Install Git from git-scm.com. We recommend you also use a tool like SourceTree if you are starting with Git. Depending on your target configuration, you will need some peer dependencies to be able to build and deploy your project.  Install AWS CLI from docs.aws.amazon.com. Then follow all steps to configure properly your credentials. Install AWS SAM CLI from docs.aws.amazon.com   Once those dependencies have been installed. You will need to create an Cloud provider account before to continue further. Go to the following page to have more information on this procedure create a cloud account\nAdditional information daSWAG uses Yeoman for code generation and Oclif to manage the CLI. To find more information, tips and help, please have a look at the Yeoman \u0026ldquo;getting starting\u0026rdquo; guide before submitting a bug.\nThe configuration will be stored in a generated .yo-rc.json file.\n"
