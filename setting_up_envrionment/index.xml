      <description>When daSWAG is used in a company, you probably will need to configure all tools to bypass the corporate proxy.
You can try to configure the HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY environment variables or use a tool like Cntlm.
But this probably won&amp;rsquo;t be enough, so you will need to configure separately all the tools that are used with daSWAG.
Introduction Supposing your proxy is defined with:
 username password host port  The resulting configuration is: http://username:password@host:port</description>

      <description>The deployment of a serverless web application requires the use of an account on the target cloud service provider. The use of such services may generate costs at the end of the month depending on your use. That&amp;rsquo;s why, you will have to fill your credit card number when creating a cloud provider account. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, daSWAG makes maximum use of free tier services, allowing you to use your application in development and integration environments with complete peace of mind.</description>
